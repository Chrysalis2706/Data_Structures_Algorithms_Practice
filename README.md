Hello Coders </>

++ This is PARTH DWIVEDI

++ Leetcode ID -> https://leetcode.com/parthdwivedy2706/

This is a comprehensive collection of various data structures and algorithms implemented in Java, along with hands-on practice exercises. As a passionate software engineer and avid learner, I've created this repository to share my knowledge and experience in this essential area of computer science.

In this repository, you'll find a wide range of topics related to data structures, ranging from the fundamental ones like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, to more complex structures such as trees, graphs, and hash tables. Each data structure is meticulously implemented in Java, ensuring efficiency, clarity, and correctness. I've included detailed comments and explanations in the code to help learners understand the logic and principles behind each implementation.

Alongside data structures, you'll also find a vast collection of algorithms. From classic sorting and searching algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, to advanced algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, dynamic programming solutions, and more â€“ I've covered them all. Each algorithm comes with a step-by-step explanation and analysis of its time and space complexity, giving learners valuable insights into their performance characteristics.
